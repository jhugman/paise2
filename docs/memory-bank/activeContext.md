## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions in Progress
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Start with "fail fast" approach, plan for isolation later
- **Job Queue Implementation**: Begin with synchronous mode, add persistence
- **Plugin State Persistence**: SQLite-based with automatic partitioning
- **Configuration File Location**: Need to determine user config location strategy

### Key Design Considerations
- **Type Safety vs Flexibility**: Balance Protocol strictness with plugin flexibility
- **Performance vs Simplicity**: Start simple, optimize based on real usage
- **Plugin Discovery**: Internal scanning vs explicit registration trade-offs
- **Resource Management**: Plugin resource limits and cleanup strategies

### Open Questions
- **Plugin Sandboxing**: When to add security isolation for plugins?
- **Dynamic Loading**: Support for runtime plugin loading/unloading?
- **Plugin Dependencies**: How to handle plugins that depend on other plugins?
- **Configuration Validation**: How strictly to validate plugin configurations?

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Protocol-First Design**: Define interfaces before implementations
- **Immutable Data Structures**: Use frozen dataclasses with copy/merge methods
- **Dependency Injection**: Singletons created by plugin system and injected
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between plugin system and business logic

### Implementation Preferences
- **Type Safety**: Use mypy-compatible type hints throughout
- **Async/Await**: Use async patterns for I/O operations and job processing
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Prefer built-in libraries when possible
- **Testable Design**: Structure code for easy unit and integration testing

### Documentation Standards
- **Protocol Documentation**: Clear docstrings for all Protocol methods
- **Plugin Examples**: Comprehensive examples for each extension point
- **API Stability**: Mark APIs as stable vs experimental
- **Migration Guides**: Document changes that affect plugin developers

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Plugin System Design Insights
- **Phased Startup Critical**: Singleton dependency ordering requires careful phase management
- **Host Interface Pattern**: Base host with extensions provides clean separation
- **State Partitioning**: Automatic partitioning by module name eliminates namespace conflicts
- **Job Queue Abstraction**: Enables both synchronous (dev) and asynchronous (prod) processing

### Development Process Insights
- **Specification First**: Comprehensive spec document essential for complex systems
- **Test Plugins Important**: Simulacra provide concrete examples and testing foundation
- **Memory Bank Value**: Documentation structure enables better context management
- **Type Safety Investment**: Protocol-based interfaces pay dividends in maintainability

### Technical Implementation Insights
- **pluggy Power**: Excellent foundation for plugin systems with minimal boilerplate
- **Protocol Benefits**: Structural typing more flexible than inheritance-based systems
- **Configuration Merging Complexity**: Need careful rules for plugin defaults vs user overrides
- **Resumable Operations**: Job queue persistence enables robust restart behavior

## Context for Collaboration

### For New Team Members
- Read the complete plugin specification first: `docs/plugins/spec.md`
- Understand the 5-phase startup sequence - it's critical to the architecture
- Study the Protocol definitions - they define the contract for all plugins
- Look at test plugin simulacra for concrete examples of each extension point

### For Plugin Developers
- Start with Protocol definitions in `interfaces.py`
- Use `@hookimpl` decorator for registration functions
- Access system services through host interfaces
- Implement test plugins first to understand patterns

### For System Integration
- Plugin discovery happens automatically by scanning for `@hookimpl` decorators
- Configuration merging follows specific rules (plugin defaults + user overrides)
- State is automatically partitioned by plugin module name
- Job queue enables both sync and async processing modes
