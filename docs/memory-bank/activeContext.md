## Current Work Focus

### COMPLETED: Profile-Based Plugin Loading System (June 11, 2025)
Complete profile system for context-dependent plugin loading (production, development, test environments). All 155 tests passing, addresses StateManager singleton selection complexity.

### Next Priority: Job Queue Provider System (PROMPT 9)
1. **Asynchronous Job Processing**: Create job queue providers for background task execution
2. **Multiple Queue Backends**: Implement memory-based and persistent queue providers
3. **Job State Management**: Add job tracking, status updates, and error handling
4. **Integration Testing**: Add job queue provider tests and performance validation

## Recent Completions

- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 23 registry tests covering discovery, registration, and validation
- ✅ **Design Issue Resolution**: Fixed fundamental hookspec callback pattern implementation

## Next Steps

### ✅ Recently Completed
1. **State Storage Provider System (PROMPT 8 - COMPLETED June 10, 2025)**
   - ✅ Created SQLiteStateStorageProvider with automatic partitioning by plugin module name
   - ✅ Added state persistence and retrieval with proper error handling
   - ✅ Implemented state versioning and schema migration support
   - ✅ Added state key enumeration and cleanup capabilities

2. **Profile-Based Plugin Loading System (COMPLETED June 11, 2025)**
   - ✅ Implemented profile-based plugin loading to resolve StateManager singleton selection issues
   - ✅ Created profile directories (production, development, test) with appropriate plugin combinations
   - ✅ Enhanced PluginManager with configurable `paise2_root` parameter
   - ✅ Added factory functions for easy profile-specific plugin manager creation

### Immediate (Current Sprint - PROMPT 9)
1. **Provider Infrastructure (PROMPT 9-11)**
   - PROMPT 9: Job Queue Provider System (NoJobQueueProvider, SQLiteJobQueueProvider)
   - PROMPT 10: Cache Provider System (File-based and memory-based cache providers)
   - PROMPT 11: Data Storage Provider System (SQLite-based storage with deduplication)

2. **Phased Startup Implementation (PROMPT 12-15)**
   - Plugin system startup sequence with 5 phases
   - Singleton creation and dependency injection
   - Startup configuration diffing implementation using StateStorage
   - End-to-end integration testing

3. **Content Processing Pipeline (PROMPT 16-20)**
   - ContentSource, ContentFetcher, ContentExtractor implementations
   - Job-based processing pipeline
   - End-to-end content processing flow

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions in Progress
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Start with "fail fast" approach, plan for isolation later
- **Job Queue Implementation**: Begin with synchronous mode, add persistence
## Next Steps

### Provider Infrastructure (PROMPT 9-11)
- Job Queue Provider System (memory and persistent backends)
- Cache Provider System (file-based and memory cache)
- Data Storage Provider System (SQLite with deduplication)

### Phased Startup Implementation (PROMPT 12-15)
- 5-phase startup sequence implementation
- Singleton creation and dependency injection
- Job-based processing pipeline

## Key Learnings

### Profile-Based Loading Success
Profile system resolved StateManager singleton selection by providing context-dependent plugin combinations for production, development, and test environments.

### Configuration Diffing Design
Simplified approach (modifications in both added/removed) proved more intuitive than separate modified section.

### State Management Pattern
Automatic partitioning by plugin module name eliminates cross-plugin interference without requiring explicit namespace management.
