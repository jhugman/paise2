## PROMPT 1: Project Foundation and Data Models

### Context
Start a greenfield Python project for the PAISE2 plugin system. This is a desktop search engine indexer that uses a plugin architecture. Focus on establishing the basic project structure and core data types.

### Task

## PROMPT 3: Plugin Registration System

### Context
With protocols defined, implement the plugin registration system using pluggy's native approach. This will handle the discovery and registration of plugin extensions.

```
Build the plugin registration system that allows plugins to register implementations of the various extension points using pluggy's hookimpl pattern.

2. Define hookspec functions for each extension point registration
3. Implement plugin scanning that finds @hookimpl decorated functions
4. Create plugin loading with proper error handling

```

### Task List
- [x] Create PluginManager class with pluggy integration
- [x] Define hookspec functions for all extension point registrations

- [x] Add logging for plugin discovery and registration
- [x] **PROMPT 3 COMPLETE** ✅

**Final Status (December 22, 2024):**
- ✅ All registry tests passing after fixing fundamental design issues
- ✅ Corrected hookspecs to use proper callback pattern from spec document
- ✅ Fixed Configuration type from `Any` to `dict[str, Any]` in models.py
- ✅ Completely rewrote registry.py with correct callback pattern implementation
- ✅ Updated mock_plugins.py (was test_plugins.py) to use individual hookimpl functions per extension type
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and plugin validation
- ✅ Plugin registration system now correctly implements pluggy callback pattern
- ✅ All 52 tests passing including both interface and registry tests

**Design Issue Resolution:**
The original implementation had fundamental flaws where hookspecs were implemented as direct provider registration instead of using the callback pattern specified in the spec document. The correct pattern uses `Callable[[ProviderType], None]` callbacks that the PluginManager calls to register plugins, not direct provider parameters in the hookspecs themselves. This has been corrected and all tests pass.

## CONFIGURATION ARCHITECTURE CLEANUP

### Context

```
Clean up and simplify the configuration architecture by removing redundant steps and creating a cleaner interface between ConfigurationFactory and ConfigurationManager.

Requirements:
1. Remove redundant step 1.5 and user_config_dict handling from StartupManager
2. Simplify ConfigurationFactory vs ConfigurationManager - hide ConfigurationManager behind ConfigurationFactory so StartupManager only deals with one interface
3. Use clearer language - "completing" instead of "diffing" throughout startup code
4. Streamline the configuration flow to be cleaner and more aligned with proper architectural patterns
5. Enhanced ConfigurationFactory with:
   - Modified `load_initial_configuration` to accept optional `user_config_dict` parameter
   - Added `complete_configuration` method to handle state persistence and change detection
6. Updated configuration extraction to handle ALL sections, not just hardcoded ones
7. Fixed all mypy and ruff issues iteratively
8. Ensure all tests continue to pass

Focus on:
- Clean architectural patterns with proper factory encapsulation
